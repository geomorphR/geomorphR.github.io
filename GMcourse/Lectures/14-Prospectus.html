### Week in Review: Overarching Goal

+ Our goals for the week were:
  + 1: Learn how to quantify anatomical shapes using points, curves, and surfaces
  + 2: Generate a set of shape variables from these data 
  + 3: Statistically evaluate hypotheses of shape variation and covariation using robust statistical methods

.pull-left[    
+ Accomplishing these goals required use of the **Procrustes Paradigm**

]

.pull-right[
+ This, then, **must** be coupled with **RRPP and effect size (Z-score) evaluation** for shape analysis: 

`$$z =\frac{\log(F) - \mu_{\log(F)}}{\sigma_{\log(F)}}$$` 
]
---

### Recall the RRPP Procedure `\(^1\)`

+ For virtually all shape-based hypotheses, we used permutation procedures (RRPP). This is embodied as:

.pull-left[
1: Fit `\(\small\mathbf{X}_{R}\)` for each `\(\small\mathbf{X}_{F}\)`; Estimate `\(\small\hat{\mathbf{Z}}_{R}\)` and `\(\small\mathbf{E}_{R}\)`

2: Permute, `\(\small\mathbf{E}_{R}\)`: obtain pseudo-values as: `\(\small\mathbf{\mathcal{Z}} = \mathbf{\hat{Z}}_{R} + \mathbf{E}_{R}\)`

3: Fit `\(\small\mathbf{X}_{F}\)` using `\(\small\mathbf{\mathcal{Z}}\)`: obtain coefficients and summary statistics

4: Calculate `\(\small{F}\)`-value (or other test statistic) in every random permutation (observed case counts as one permutation)

5: For `\(\small{n}\)` permutations, `\(\small{P} = \frac{n(F_{random} \geq F_{obs})}{n}\)`
]
.pull-right[
6: Calculate *effect size* as a standard deviate of the observed value in a normalized distribution of random values (helps for comparing effects within and between models); i.e.:
`$$\small{z} = \frac{
\log\left( F\right) - \mu_{\log\left(F\right)}
} {
 \sigma_{\log\left(F\right)}
}$$`
where `\(\small\mu_{\log\left(F\right)}\)` and `\(\sigma_{\log\left(F\right)}\)` are the expected value and standard deviation from the sampling distribution, respectively.

### Procrustes Paradigm and RRPP: Present Applications

What we learned this week: Procrustes + RRPP with effect sizes ( `\(Z\)`-scores) provides the tools to evaluate an inordinately large breadth of biological hypotheses related to shape variation.  A partial list includes:

+ 1: General linear model (GLM) questions: 
  + Do groups differ in shape (manova)?
  + Is there covariation between shape and a continuous variable (regression)?
  + Is there variation in shape across multiple effects (factorial models)?
  + Is there an association between shape &amp; `\(\small\mathbf{X}\)` while accounting for phylogeny (PGLS models)? 
+ 2: 'Advanced' GLM questions: 
  + Which groups differ in shape; which slopes differ in terms of shape covariation (pairwise comparisons)?
  + Do pairs of groups differ in their magnitude or direction of shape change (trajectory analysis)?
  + Are there differences in the degree of shape disparity (dispersion) among groups?

---
    
### Procrustes Paradigm and RRPP: Present Applications (Cont.)

+ 3: Covariation questions:
  + Does shape covary with another set of variables (partial least squares - PLS)?
  + Is the degree of covariation greater in one dataset than another (z-score comparisons)?
+ 4: Phylogenetic questions: 
  + What is the degree of phylogenetic signal in shape?
  + Does shape covary with other variables while accounting for phylogenetic relatedness (PGLS and P-PLS)?
  + Do rates of phenotypic shape evolution differ?
+ 5: GM-specific questions: 
  + Is there shape asymmetry? Is it directional or fluctuating? 
  + For repeated shapes, is measurement error a concern?
  + Is there modular signal in my data?  Integrated signal? 
  + Is the degree of modularity (or integration) greater in one dataset relative to another?
  + Are there allometric patterns of shape variation? 

###### NOTE: A huge advantage of what we learned this week is the visualization of patterns of shape variation (i.e., statistical plots), combined with visualizations of shape deformations (predicted values, group means, etc.)

---

### What's Left to Do?

+ Given the breadth of topics we covered, one might reasonably ask "In terms of theory, is there anything left to do?"

+ Can empiricists expect additional novel approaches to be developed going forward, that help biologists address new and important questions?

--

+ We argue the answer to this question is **YES**!!

+ Here are some recent '*Up and Coming*' methods from Dean and Mike, as well as our musings on other possible areas of future work
---


### Current 1: Dimensions of Phylogenetic Signal 

+ The degree to which phenotypic similarity associates with phylogenetic relatedness

&lt;img src="LectureData/14.prospectus/PhySigConcept.png" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

+ For multivariate data, we have `\(K_{mult}=\frac{\mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{Z},E(\mathbf{Z})}^{T}\mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{Z},E(\mathbf{Z})}}{\mathbf{PD}_{\tilde{\mathbf{Z}},0}^{T}\mathbf{PD}_{\tilde{\mathbf{Z}},0}}/\frac{tr(\mathbf\Omega)-N(\mathbf{1}^{T}\mathbf{\Omega1})^{-1}}{N-1}\)`

---

### Current 1: Dimensions of Phylogenetic Signal 

+ 100s of GMM (and other) studies have utilized `\(K_{mult}\)`: 

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="LectureData/14.prospectus/PhySigWeakHist.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

+ Such patterns often interpreted as "Significant, but weak phylogenetic signal"
]

--

.pull-right[

&lt;img src="LectureData/14.prospectus/PhySigSimul.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

+ But phylogenetic signal could be "concentrated" in a few dimensions
]

+ How do we evaluate dimensions of phylogenetic signal in multivariate data? 

---

### Current 1: Dimensions of Phylogenetic Signal: Computations 

+ Re-examine `\(K\)` and decompose it into component dimensions$^1$

+ Numerator of `\(K_{mult}\)` is ratio of covariance matrices: 

`$$\frac{tr\left((\mathbf{Z}-E(\mathbf{Z}))^T(\mathbf{Z}-E(\mathbf{Z})\right)}{tr\left((\mathbf{Z}-E(\mathbf{Z}))^T\mathbf\Omega^{-1}(\mathbf{Z}-E(\mathbf{Z}))\right)} = \frac{tr(SSCP_0)}{tr(SSCP_{\Omega})}$$` 
--

So rather than finding the trace of each component separately, summarize them as: 

`$$K= \frac{SSCP_0}{SSCP_{\Omega}} = SSCP_{\Omega}^{-1}SSCP_0$$`

This is a *relative eigenanalysis* of `\(SSCP_0\)` relative to `\(SSCP_{\Omega}\)`


.footnote[1. Mitteroecker, Collyer, Adams. (2024: In Press). *Syst.Biol.*]
---

### Current 1: Dimensions of Phylogenetic Signal: Computations 

+ Perform *relative eigenanalysis* of `\(SSCP_0\)` relative to `\(SSCP_{\Omega}\)`

`$$K= \frac{SSCP_0}{SSCP_{\Omega}} = SSCP_{\Omega}^{-1}SSCP_0$$`

+ Next, decompose as: `\(K=\mathbf{E}\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\mathbf{E}^T\)`

+ Diagonal elements of `\(\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\)` are eigenvalues

+ Summarize eigenvalues: `\(tr(K)=\sum\delta_i\)` and `\(det(K)=\prod\delta_i\)`

+ Evaluate statistically via permutation
  + Note: `\(H_0\)` is that `\(SSCP_0\)` and `\(SSCP_{\Omega}\)` are proportional, so:  `\(H_0 = \delta_1 = \delta_2 = \delta_3...\)`

### Current 2: Phylogenetic Comparison of Microevolutionary Patterns

.pull-left[
Contemporary timescales: evaluate trends within species (microevolution)

&lt;img src="LectureData/14.prospectus/Micro.png" width="95%" /&gt;

.pull-right[
Macroevolutionary timescales: evaluate trends across the phylogeny

&lt;img src="LectureData/14.prospectus/Macro.png" width="95%" /&gt;

Evaluated via phylogenetic comparative methods
]

--

+ When comparing intraspecific trends across species, we ***should*** account for phylogenetic nonindependence

+ How can we do that? 
---

### Current 2: PCMs and Multiple Individuals

PCMs use 1 individual per species (e.g., species means)

  - Assumes `\(\sigma^2_{within.spp} &lt;&lt;  \sigma^2_{among.spp}\)`

--

Using species means in presence of `\(\sigma^2_{within.spp}\)` is problematic 

- Can `\(\uparrow\)` bias in parameter estimates
- Can `\(\uparrow\)` type I error, `\(\downarrow\)` power, and `\(\uparrow\)` model misspecification 

--

Some PCMs can include intraspecific variation (Ives et al. 2007; Felsenstein 2008), but

- `\(\sigma^2_{within.spp}\)` is unstructured sampling error around the mean
- In other words, assume within-species variation is **random** (i.e., measurement error)

What about within-species variation that is not random? 

How can we account for it (or compare it across species)?
---

### Current 2: Extended Phylogenetic Least Squares (E-PGLS) `\(^1\)`

+ E-PGLS provide a bridge between micro- and macroevolutionary patterns
  + Can evaluate cross-species trends of trait covariation (univariate and multivariate) based on multiple individuals per species
  + Can compare within-species patterns across species while conditioning on the phylogeny

+ E-PGLS combines: 

  + Hierarchical linear model 
  + Expanded phylogenetic covariance matrix
  + Novel permutation procedure 

.footnote[1. Adams and Collyer (In Review)]

### Current 2: E-PGLS: Procedure

+ The E-PGLS model: `\(\mathbf{Z} = \mathbf{X}_S \hat{\mathbf{B}}_S + \mathbf{X}_X \hat{\mathbf{B}}_X + \mathbf{X}_{C_{X}}\hat{\mathbf{B}}_{C_{X}} + \mathbf{E}\)`

+ Phenotypic data, `\(\mathbf{Z}\)`, is described by a partitioned model, `\(\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{X}_S \vert \mathbf{X}_X \vert \mathbf{X}_{C_X}\)`, with residual error, `\(\mathbf{E}\)`, distributed as `\(\mathbf{E} \sim \mathcal{MN}(0,\boldsymbol{\Omega}_{n})\)`
    + `\(\boldsymbol{\Omega}_n\)` is an expanded phylogenetic covariance matrix

### Future 1: An Improved Procrustes Algorithm

+ Recall the workhorse of geometric morphometrics: the Generalized Procrustes Analysis (superimposition)
  + Translate all specimens to a common location
  + Scale all specimens to unit centroid size
  + Optimally rotate all specimens to minimize LS deviations

### Future 1: An Improved Procrustes Algorithm

.pull-left[
+ Mathematically, GPA assumes that all landmarks are 'iid' (independent, and identically distributed) in terms of their error distribution

+ This implies that the values for each landmark of each specimen are derived from a circular normal distribution, which is independent landmark by landmark

+ Such an assumption is unrealistic
]

--

.pull-right[
+ For example, recall the 'Pinocchio effect'

&lt;img src="LectureData/03.superimposition/GRF-Example.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

]

--

+ Here, some landmarks display greater variation than do others (and GRF was proposed to 'account' for this, via an ad-hoc procedure)

+ Also, consider the possibility that some landmarks are correlated with others (i.e., landmark changes are correlated)

+ Neither of these conditions is considered by GPA, as it is OLS (=unweighted)
---

### Future 1: Towards A Weighted Procrustes Algorithm

+ To this point (and for the past 25 years), we have conducted superimposition using GPA, which is an unweighted alignment

+ That is, one translates, rotates, and scales, using mean values

+ As implemented (and as described this week), these steps assume that all landmarks contribute equally during the alignment.

+ This is tantamount to including a `\(\mathbf{I}_{pk}\)` identity matrix within the GPA algorithm

--

+ One could consider a 'weighted GPA' where the translation, rotation, and scale are performed relative to a landmark-coordinate covariance matrix (much like one performs OLS = unweighted regression versus PGLS =  phylogenetically-weighted regression)

+ The algebra for this is well-established statistically, but the 'weighting' covariance matrix in this case is highly singular, causing mathematical difficulties
---

### Future 1: Towards A Weighted Procrustes Algorithm

.pull-left[
+ Some approximations have been proposed (e.g., Theobald and Wuttke 2006)

&lt;img src="LectureData/14.prospectus/WGPATheobald.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]
.pull-right[
+ Here (with simplifying assumptions), one can align protein structures allowing for different variation among landmarks, but with equal variation within (i.e., using a partitioned `\(\hat{\mathbf\Sigma}=\mathbf\Sigma_p\otimes\Sigma_k\)`)

+ We are currently developing a general algorithm for weighted GPA that relaxes all of these assumptions, and where the 'standard' GPA approach would be a special case algorithm
]
---

### Future 2: Integration and Modularity: A Spatial Perspective

+ The past decade has seen a wonderful resurgence of interest in modularity and integration

+ This has lead to the development of numerous approaches for *quantifying* such patterns

--

+ Recent work (Bookstein 2016) highlighted the need to explore integration across spatial scales 

+ This begs the question: should other (all?) patterns of integration and modularity among sub-units be evaluated relative to some 'null' expectation beyond that of the empirical sampling distribution derived from permuting landmarks into modules?

--

+ We contend that this is an important issue for future investigation

+ Our perspective is to consider the **spatial** proximity of landmarks in developing a null model for integration and modularity tests
---

### Future 2: Spatial Integration and Modularity

.pull-left[
+ In ecology, data obtained from different geographic localities is expected to covary due to their *spatial proximity*

+ In other words, geographically proximate locations are expected to be more similar, and covary more highly, than are geographically less proximate locations

&lt;img src="LectureData/14.prospectus/SpatialCov.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

--

.pull-right[
+ For morphometrics, **anatomical proximity** is akin to geographic proximity in spatial statistics

+ We contend that null models of integration and modularity should be **conditioned** on anatomical proximity; analogously to spatial proximity issues

&lt;img src="LectureData/14.prospectus/Mouse.png" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

+ We are presently developing integration and modularity methods that evaluate patterns relative to this anatomical proximity

### Future 3: Multivariate Model Comparison

+ The goal is to evaluate two or more models with different sets of parameters to determine if one is 'better' based on criteria quantifying the *fit* of the data to those models.

+ Procedurally, model fit is often obtained using likelihood:

`$$\mathcal{L}(\hat{\beta}|\textbf{y}) = \frac{e^{-\frac{1}{2}( \textbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\hat\beta)^T\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}^{-1} ( \textbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\hat\beta)}}{\sqrt{2\pi^{np}|\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}|}}$$`
+ Likelihood ratio tests are then performed to compare models

`$$-2\lambda_{LR}= -2*\frac{\mathcal{L}(\hat{\beta}_0|\textbf{y})}{\mathcal{L}(\hat{\beta}_1|\textbf{y})} \sim\chi^2$$`

--

+ LRT-based hypothesis testing is what we've used throughout this workshop to evaluate linear models 

+ Possible shortcomings include: 
  + Model overfitting (improper application can lead one to infer that an overly complicated model is best)
  + LRT is commonly not used for non-nested models (though it can be: Vuong 1989; Lewis et al. 2011)


---

### Future 3: Multivariate Model Comparison

+ Models are also compared using indexing measures of penalized likelihood (e.g., AIC).

`$$AIC = -2\mathcal{L}(\hat{\beta}|\textbf{y}) + 2[pk+0.5p(p+1)]$$`

+ Lower AIC values represent preferred models, with a cut-off typically stated as `\(\small\Delta_{AIC} &gt; 4\)` (for *univariate* data)

--

+ AIC (and similar) measures represent a 'balance' between model fit and the number of parameters used

+ They are related to Kullback–Leibler information theory, and are a sort of 'distance'

+ Note that for multivariate data, the parameter penalty can become quite 'heavy')


---

### Model Comparison via RRPP-Based Effect Sizes

+ One can combine the strengths of LRT and AIC via RRPP-based effect sizes

  + For each candidate model, `\(\mathcal{L}(\hat{\beta}|\textbf{y})\)` can be obtained
  + RRPP may be used to generate an empirical sampling distribution of `\(\mathcal{L}(\hat{\beta}|\textbf{y})\)`
  + An effect size, `\(Z\)`-score, may be calculated for each model

--

+ Larger `\(Z\)`-scores imply a stronger strength of signal for that model

+ This is akin to a 'distance' of the candidate model relative to an intercept model: `\(Z \sim 1\)`
+ The model with the largest `\(Z\)`-score is the best model
+ NOTE: one can also perform two-sample comparisons of effect sizes (sensu Adams and Collyer 2016; 2019) to compare models

---

+ Here is a simple (univariate: snake head size: CS) example using AIC:

### Future 3: Multivariate Model Comparison: Example

+ And now let's look at the effect sizes of the models:


``` r
model.comparison(f.0, f.svl, f.sex, f.reg, f.svl.reg, f.svl.by.reg, type = "Z")
```

```
##                                    Z
## 1                         -0.2679764
## svl                        2.3502504
## sex                       -0.8901494
## region                     1.7070038
## svl + region               2.8300695
## svl + region + svl:region  2.6081491
```

+ Again in this case, the model with the strongest signal is `\(\small{Size}={Sex}+{Region}\)` 

+ **Clearly, there is considerable work left to do to verify this new theoretical procedure, but the initial concept of using `\(Z\)`-scores from RRPP for model comparison is promising!** *Stay tuned...*
