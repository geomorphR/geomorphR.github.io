### Recall, the general linear model provides

+ Estimation of coefficients, `\(\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}\)`
+ Fitted values, based on estimate coefficients, `\(\hat{\mathbf{Z}} = \mathbf{X}\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}\)`.  (Residuals can also be found as `\(\mathbf{E} =\mathbf{Z} - \hat{\mathbf{Z}}\)`.)
+ Covariance matrices for residual variation:

`$$\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{residuals} = (n-k)^{-1}\mathbf{\tilde{E}}^T\mathbf{\tilde{E}}$$`

+ Covariance matrices for the effect of adding model parameters to a null model.

`$$\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{effect} = (k-1)^{-1}(\hat{\mathbf{Z}}_{alt}-\hat{\mathbf{Z}}_{null})^T(\hat{\mathbf{Z}}_{alt}-\hat{\mathbf{Z}}_{null})$$`
**Because linear models describe hypothetical explanations for variation in shape data, it is generally of interest to test null hypotheses for putative models.**  There are various ways to do this, but any method is a *proxy* for a true distribution of possible random outcomes of a statistic calculated from covariance matrices.

The best way to to generate random distributions of statistics is to randomize residuals (from null models) in a permutation procedure (RRPP).

### Hypothesis testing for linear model effects 

**Some nomenclature**

**Intercept**. A single parameter, as a vector of 1s, to estimate a mean in the absence of other parameters.

**Parameter**.  A linear model parameter is any column of an `\(\mathbf{X}\)` matrix.  

**Coefficient**. An estimate of a population parameter that describes the change in response or dependent variable (in `\(\mathbf{Z}\)`) per one-unit change in a linear model parameter.

**Term**.  Terms are collective parameters added to `\(\mathbf{X}\)` that are used to model an effect.  For example, to estimate the *effect of population*, the term, `Population` might be added to a linear model comprising 8 parameters in `\(\mathbf{X}\)`, because there are 9 total populations for which to estimate means.

**Effect**. The change in model estimates based on adding a term to a model.  Essentially, this is the change in fitted values (or residuals) as a result of adding parameters associated with a term to a null model.

**Null hypothesis**. The starting position that adding a term to a null model does not change the estimates made by the null model, suggesting, therefore, that the additional parameters are not needed.
---

### Hypothesis testing for linear model effects (cont.)

**Fitted values**. The estimates a linear model makes for the data from independent variables used to *train* the model.

**Predicated value**. An estimate made with the coefficients from a linear model for data sampled from the same independent variables, but not necessarily the same data used to fit the model.

**Residuals**. Values that express the difference between observed response or dependent variable data and estimates made from the linear model.  If observations are similar to estimates, residuals are small, and the model is considered "good".

**Model comparison**. A technique used to compare the estimates made by competing models, in terms of how precise they are to match observations.  Model comparison is the basis for hypothesis testing.  If one model is much better at matching observations than another, the probability is high that its additional parameters are important, and some biological phenomenon is real.

---

### Hypothesis testing for linear model effects (cont.)

A null hypothesis test is one that tests the independence of alternative model projections.  Null and alternative hypotheses can be thought of as this series of dichotomies (becoming increasingly more technical):

|Null hypothesis | Alternative hypothesis|
|----|----|
|A null model and alternative model are approximately equally viable for explaining the variation in a data set. | The alternative model is an improvement over the null model for explaining variation in a data set.|
|The residual covariance matrices are similar between null and alternative models. | The residual covariance matrices are different between null and alternative models, and the variances along the diagonal of the alternative model covariance matrix are smaller.|
|A statistic based on the covariance matrix for the effect of adding parameters to the null model to obtain the alternative model is not unlike what one would expect by chance. | A statistic based on the covariance matrix for the effect of adding parameters to the null model to obtain the alternative model is rare in a sampling distribution.
| `\(S \approx 0\)` | `\(S &gt; 0\)`|

Every test of a null hypothesis must have a process of generating randomness under the null hypothesis.  For the case of linear models, RRPP is a good way to approximate true sampling distributions.

---
### Hypothesis testing for linear model effects (cont.)

We will use one general way of stating a null hypothesis.  This is unconventional but it is a simple and powerful approach.

`$$\boldsymbol{\Theta}_{\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{alt} |\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_0 } = \boldsymbol{\Theta}_{0}$$`

Let `\(\boldsymbol{\Theta}\)` be a **matrix (or vector) of contrasts between fitted values of two models**.  This is the same as a matrix (or vector) of contrasts between residuals of two models.  Basically, it is a difference of estimation between two models!

Let `\(\boldsymbol{\Theta}_0\)` be the expectation that the difference in estimation between models is a matrix or vector of 0s.  This is a way to say the two models tell us the same thing.  It is unlikely that this could be true, but if values are close to 0, it is likely the models are not that different.

Let `\(\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{alt} |\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_0\)` represent that the contrast between two models is a null model as the reference and an alternative model as the one with additional parameters.  Recall, `\(\tilde{\mathbf{H}}\)` is the hat matrix that finds (transformed) fitted values of the data, based on a linear model.


---

### Exchangeable units under a null hypothesis

***Have you ever wondered what parametric distributions are all about?***  You might have a comfort with them but have you thought about the pursuit of them?  They are a good proxy under certain conditions for probability distributions of random outcomes of a process applied to a null model (set of conditions that allow an observed statistics to exist but do not influence it).

One might realize that there are a finite set of random possibilities, at least based on a sample of data, but enumerating all possibilities is perhaps not possible, or at least excruciating.

Parametric probability density functions that can be integrated are one way to have a proxy for the true sampling distribution.  **Resampling procedures** are another.  The latter means to resample data from a sample as if the stratigraphic bounds inherent in the data are removed, for the purpose of simulating random outcomes sampling from a single population. 

Unfortunately, resampling procedures have tended to historically involve either randomizing data or sampling data with replacement (a bootstrap technique).  Although statistical research has been done to identify how to resample data, many applications just default to a simple randomizing of data, as if this is either appropriate or sufficient.

---

### Exchangeable units under a null hypothesis

Nevertheless, there is a simple way to consider the appropriateness of resampling techniques `\(^1\)`.  Resampling techniques are best if they have

|Attribute|Meaning|
|------|-----------|
|First-moment exchangeability| The mean of the sample is the same with every random permutation of the sample|
|Second-moment exchangeability| The covariance matrix of the sample is the same in every random permutation of the sample.|

For example, if we have 10 specimens from a phylogenetic clade with two ecotypes, we find the mean specimen shape as a null model and mean ecotype shapes as an alternative model, we might use a randomization procedure that randomly assigns specimens to ecotype and re-estimates the ecotype means many times.  **For OLS estimation, this method has first- and second-moment exchangeability,**  Why?  Because the overall mean and covariance matrix for the null model are the same in every random permutation.

### Exchangeable units under a null hypothesis

However, specimens are species values form a clade, so a GLS solution that accounts for phylogenetic relatedness should be used, assuming shapes are not independent.  **.red[For GLS estimation, this method lacks first- and second-moment exchangeability!]**  The GLS mean and covariance structure will change in every permutation if the specimens and their phylogenetic covariances become mismatched.

.blue[Through a bit of research, we have found that] **.blue[randomization of transformed null model residuals]** .blue[is the best, universal solution for maintaining (approximately) first- and second-moment exchangeability for most linear model designs.]

We have also found that when the conditions are appropriate that parametric probability density function assumptions are apt, randomization of (transformed) residuals in a permutation procedure (RRPP) produces the same distributions as parametric functions.

Henceforth, only RRPP statistical solutions will be presented.

---

### Randomization of residuals in a permutation procedure (RRPP) `\(^1\)`

**The steps for RRPP, performed in every permutation**

1: Fit a *null* linear model, and calculate both transformed fitted values and transformed residuals.  (Recall that is OLS estimation is used, the fitted values and residuals are not transformed.)

2: Permute, `\(\small\mathbf{\tilde{E}}_{0}\)`: obtain pseudo-values as: `\(\small\mathbf{\mathcal{Z}} = \mathbf{\tilde{H}_{0}{\tilde{Z}}}_{0} + \mathbf{\tilde{E}}_{0}^*\)`

3: Fit `\(\small\mathbf{X}_{alt}\)` using `\(\small\mathbf{\mathcal{Z}}\)`: obtain coefficients, fitted values, residuals.

4: Obtain `\(\boldsymbol{\Theta}^{*}_{\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{alt} |\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_0 }\)` by contrasting either fitted values or residuals between the null and alternative models. .remark-code[.blue[Generally, a covariance matrix is estimated from the cross-product of]] `\(\boldsymbol{\Theta}_{\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{alt} |\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_0 }\)` .remark-code[.blue[for linear model effects: `\(\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{effect}^*\)`, where the]] `\(^*\)` .remark-code[.blue[superscript indicates this is a random value from a large set of random values.]]

5: Calculate some statistic, `\(S\)`, consistently from either every  `\(\boldsymbol{\Theta}^{*}_{\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{alt} |\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_0 }\)`, `\(\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{residuals}^*\)`, or `\(\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{effect}^*\)` matrix estimated in every RRPP permutation.

### Randomization of residuals in a permutation procedure (RRPP) `\(^1\)`

**Steps for calculating statistics from RRPP**

6: For `\(\small{n}\)` permutations, `\(\small{P} = \frac{(S^* \geq S_{obs})}{n}\)`

7: Calculate *effect size* as a standard deviate of the observed value in a normalized distribution of random values (helps for comparing effects within and between models); i.e.:
`$$\small{Z} = \frac{
\theta_{obs} - \mu_{\theta}
} {
 \sigma_{\theta}
}$$`
where `\(\mu\)` and `\(\sigma\)` are the expected value and standard deviation from the sampling distribution of the normalized distribution, `\(\theta\)`, respectively.

# Part II. Common Test Statistics
]

We are not going to go over the following in detail.  This is a snapshot of the same material in the Appendix.  The intention is to reveal how deep the scope of hypothesis testing can be.

Each statistic is used to test the null hypothesis, 

`$$H_0: \boldsymbol{\Theta}_{\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{alt} |\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_0 } = \boldsymbol{\Theta}_{0}$$`
With the alternative hypothesis,

`$$H_A: \boldsymbol{\Theta}_{\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{alt} |\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_0 } \neq \boldsymbol{\Theta}_{0}$$`
Most can converted to `\(H_0: S = 0\)` and `\(H_A: S &gt; 0\)`, respetively, for a statistic, `\(S\)`, which summarizes, `\(\boldsymbol{\Theta}_{\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{alt} |\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_0 }\)`.

**All of these statistics can be tested with RRPP.**

The purpose is not to become quickly comfortable with them but to see that there are various statistics that can be used for various purposes.  Examples will indicate statistics used and this list (**also in the appendix**) can be quickly referenced.  Focus more so on RRPP, what the null model is, how residuals are randomized, and how the opportunity to calculate these statistics is made.

### Viable test statistics for evaluating null hypotheses

**General comments**

+ ANOVA statistics are based on dispersion of points in the multivariate space.  **Because a distance between point estimates in the space is univariate, regardless of the dimensions of the space, the number of variables `\((p)\)` is irrelevant.**  However, the covariances among variables of the data space do not influence the statistics.

+ MANOVA and likelihood statistics are based on covariance matrix determinants.  **Because a determinant is singular if variables exceed observations, these statistics can be limited to cases of "long" rather than "wide" data sets.**  However, in certain cases they can have more statistical power because of their innate ability to consider covariance structure.

+ RRPP-specific statistics tend to be more informative as descriptive statistics.  **Because RRPP can be a proxy for the true sampling distributions of statistics that have no parametric probability density function, RRPP is uniquely qualified to test certain hypotheses.**  ANOVA or MANOVA statistics often "go along for the ride" but are unneeded if good specific test statistics can be used.

+ Coefficient-specific test statistics generally offer little appeal, as statistics summarizing several coefficients as *effects* are easier to appreciate.  But coefficients, themselves, can be informative.

### Linear Model Examples

A series of linear model examples will be presented, first using `geomorph::pupfish` data.  For these examples, OLS estimation is used, so no transformation is required; i.e., `\(\mathbf{\tilde{Z}} = \mathbf{Z}\)`, `\(\mathbf{\tilde{X}} = \mathbf{X}\)`, and `\(\mathbf{\tilde{E}} = \mathbf{E}\)`. An example will also be provided to highlight GLS estimation, using the `geomorph::plethspecies` data.

For each example, expect the following:

1. Purpose 
2. Description of `\(\mathbf{X}\)`
3. Estimation of `\(\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}\)`
4. Description of what `\(\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}\)` informs
5. Null and alternative hypotheses
6. Hypothesis test results, with interpretations

### Linear regression example

1. Purpose: Test the allometric relationship between body size and body shape.
2. `\(\mathbf{X}_{alt}\)` is an `\(n \times 2\)` matrix with first vector a vector of 1s and second vector the log of centroid size, `\(\log{CS}\)`

**Let's set everything up!**


``` r
library(geomorph)
data("pupfish")
system.time(fit &lt;- procD.lm(coords ~ log(CS), data = pupfish,
                iter = 9999, verbose = TRUE, turbo = FALSE))
```

```
##    user  system elapsed 
##   1.517   0.072   1.608
```

Yup, that is 10,000 RRPP permutations in less than 2 seconds.  We will understand what happened soon.

The coefficients provide an intercept and slope for each shape variable.  Thus, the row vectors of `\(\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}\)` are `\(\mathbf{b}_0^T\)`, a vector of intercepts, and `\(\mathbf{b}_1^T\)`, a vector of slopes.  We can explicitly test their length to ascertain if the multivariate slope -- the change in shape associated with size -- is significant.

.remark-code[.red[Look at the second row of the coefficients above.  The sign of the values does not matter.  It's the square of the values and whether they are quite different from 0 that confirms a significant amount of shape change associated with size change.]]

We would allow with 95% confidence that a vector length of 0.047 could be obtained by chance.  Beyond this, we reject the null hypothesis that there is no shape change associated with size change.  The observed vector length of 0.11 is much larger than 0.57, such that the observed value is 4.14 `\(SD\)` greater than expect by chance.

### Let's stop here for a moment and come up for air!

Basically we learned via any statistic that there is significant size-shape allometry!  Did it matter which statistic we used?

**What is more important is to understand that the null model estimated just the mean shape.  (The linear model design was a vector of 1s.)  The residuals from this model were randomized 10,000 times.  (The observed case is one random permutation).  Regardless of statistic, we generated 10,000 linear models and ask how rare was the observed case for a statistic calculated for all 10,000 random permutations.**

We will just keep doing this until it makes sense.

### Linear regression example

**Conclusions**
+ Allometric shape variation is significant, `\(P = 0.0001\)`. Choose any statistic and associated `\(Z\)`... Allometric shape variation also has a large effect size.
+ As fish increase in size, they become more deep-bodied, and their eye size increases at a slower rate than their body size.

### Linear regression example, GLS coefficient estimation

1. Purpose: Test the allometric relationship between body size and body shape in plethodontid salamander **species**.
2. `\(\mathbf{X}_{alt}\)` is an `\(n \times 2\)` matrix with first vector a vector of 1s and second vector the log of centroid size, `\(\log{CS}\)`

We can set this up two ways:

### Linear regression example, GLS coefficient estimation

Note that the `procD.pgls` function can perform the same analysis with input of a class `phylo` object (tree) rather than a covariance matrix.  

What this example shows is the GLS estimation gets us to the same place, without assuming observations are independent.  The statistics changed a little (but allometry was not significant).  There might be cases where a significant effect **BECAUSE** of phylogenetic relatedness is rendered non-significant after accounting for the non-independence of observations.

Now let's move onto different types of effects.

### Shape differences among groups, example

What have we learned?

The coefficients tell us that (1) the first group assumes the intercept location, and then (2) each other coefficient indicates the change in shape expected for a different group, **from the first group's location**.  With 3 coefficients, we can explain the differences in location of groups 2-4, from 1.  (*This is why `\(k-1\)`  `\(df\)` are all that is needed to explain group shape variation, after a mean has been established.*)

If we only had the intercept, we would only have one overall mean.  Adding parameters meant the overall mean became rather the group 1 mean.

There are four levels in `\(\mathbf{X}_{alt}\)`:

|Group | `\(\mathbf{x}^T\)`|
|----|----|
|Females, Marsh | `\(1 0 0 0\)`|
|Males, Marsh | `\(1 1 0 0\)`|
|Females, Sinkhole | `\(1 0 1 0\)`|
|Females, Sinkhole | `\(1 0 0 1\)`|
---

### Shape differences among groups, example

What have we learned?

These dummy variables turn on and off the coefficients.  For every individual fish, the first coefficient is "turned on".  Then either none (Females from Marsh) are turned on or one other vector of coefficients, if changing to a different group.

### Shape differences among groups, example

1. Purpose: Test whether males and females, or fish from sinkhole ponds or marshes have different shapes≥
2. `\(\mathbf{X}_{alt}\)` is an `\(n \times 4\)` matrix with first vector a vector of 1s and the next three vectors are ***dummy variables***.
3. Coefficients
4. Hypothesis tests

|Style|Null hypothesis|Alternative hypothesis|
|---|----|-------|
|Model contrast| `\(H_0: \boldsymbol{\Theta}_{\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{alt} \vert\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_0 } = \boldsymbol{\Theta}_{0}\)` | `\(H_A: \boldsymbol{\Theta}_{\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{alt} \vert\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_0 } \neq \boldsymbol{\Theta}_{0}\)` |
|Statistic| `\(S = 0\)` | `\(S &gt; 0\)` |
|Concept | `\(H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = ...\)` | `\(H_A: \mu_1 \neq \mu_2\)` or `\(\mu_1 \neq \mu_3\)` or `\(\mu_2 \neq \mu_2...\)`|
|In words | No group means are different | At least one group means differs from one other group mean.|

The statistic, `\(S\)`, can be one of `\(SS\)`, `\(R^2\)`, `\(MS\)`, `\(F\)`, `\(\lambda_{Roy}\)`, `\(\lambda_{Wilks}\)`, etc.  Note, however, that with ANOVA statistics, `\(=\)` or `\(\neq\)` considers .red[difference between locations in multivariate data space].  With MANOVA statistics, `\(=\)` or `\(\neq\)` considers .blue[differences between the covariance structures of residual covariance matrices].

We will just do one ANOVA, using `\(F\)` statistics and one MANOVA, using `\(\lambda_{Roy}\)` statistics.  ***Note that there are internal methods for dealing with the fact that `\(p &gt; n\)`.  The function finds the appropriate number of PCs to use in lieu of Procrustes coordinates.**

### Shape differences among groups, example

Conclusions?

Every shape mean appears to be unique, as each is significantly different from every other.

**But this is not the full story!**  What comes next is rather important.

**TECHNICAL NOTE**

Henceforth to keep things simple, we will present primarily hat matrices, e.g., 

`$$\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{mean},$$`
`$$\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{allometry},$$`
`$$\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{group:means},$$`
recalling the `\(\tilde{\mathbf{H}}\)` matrices find (transformed) fitted values based on suites of parameters.  To test is group means are divergent, as in the last example, is a test of `\(\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{mean}\)` versus `\(\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{group:means}\)`.

### What just happened??

### Multi-model comparisons

Biological hypotheses would be boring if they were always `\(\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{mean}\)` versus `\(\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{something}\)`.

There are often multiple hypotheses for multiple levels of organization or multiple phenomena that could be considered.  Sometimes the organization is hierarchical, like female and male fish that could differ in shape, living in habitats that might impose also difference in shape.  Sometimes separate explanations might be relevant, like fish vary in shape as they vary with size or they vary in shape between habitats.

Ultimately, if we add every possible factor for variation in our data to a model, there exists some finite number of smaller, *nested* models that could be considered.

.remark-code[What the previous result showed is that groups comprised other groups: sex and population from which fish were sampled.  We can have various sub-models that can be compared in certain ways.]

### Multi-model comparisons

+ Let `\(\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{mean}\)` always be THE null model
+ Let `\(\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{reduced}\)` be a model that serves as a null model for an alternative model.  It is either the null model or one lacking parameters in the alternative.
+ Let `\(\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{full}\)` be the alternative model, having some parameters the reduced model lacks.
+ Let the parameters that differ between `\(\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{full}\)` and `\(\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_{reduced}\)` constitute a **.blue[TERM]** and let the coefficients estimated by the term constitute an **.red[EFFECT]**.

### Multi-model comparisons

.pull-left[.med[
Logic has to dictate which type of SSCP philosophy to use, or whether to just compare the models one wishes to compare, without using all permutations of model comparisons.

For example


``` r
fit.pop &lt;- procD.lm(coords ~ Pop, data = pupfish)
fit.all &lt;- procD.lm(coords ~ Pop * Sex, data = pupfish)
anova(fit.pop, fit.all)
```
]]
.pull-right[

**Some things to keep in mind**

+ Only in the case of Type I SSCPs the sum of the effect `\(SS\)` is the same as the total `\(SS\)` (residual `\(SS\)` of the null model).
+ With Type I SSCPs, the **order of terms matters!**  If one changes the order they change the effect, because the reduced models have changed.
+ Order does not matter with Type II or Type III SSCPs.
+ Type III SSCPs might not seem to make a lot of sense on inspection but can be very helpful with linear mixed models (combination of fixed and random effects) `\(^1\)`.

### Multi-model comparisons, not involving hypothesis tests

For ANOVA, MANOVA, and likelihood ratio tests, models must be nested

What if the one you want to test are not nested?  Or what if you are not explicitly interested in the significance of model effects but just wish to evaluate which models explain the most variation with the fewest parameters?

### Multi-model comparisons, not involving hypothesis tests

Let's start by considering a panoply of possible models for the pupfish data.  Our candidate models look like this:

|Model|Terms|Purpose|
|---|------|------------|
|`fit0`|Mean| Baseline null model.|
|`fit1`| `\(\log CS\)` | General allometry.|
|`fit2`|Sex | Sexual dimorphism.|
|`fit3`|Pop | Ecological shape divergence.|
|`fit4`| `\(\log CS\)` + Sex| Sexual dimorphism, accounting for allometry.|
|`fit5`| `\(\log CS\)` + Pop| Ecological divergence, accounting for allometry.|

### Multi-model comparisons, not involving hypothesis tests

**Comments:**

Be wary of AIC scores or the likelihoods that generate them when calculated at the limit of possible data dimensions, because `\(p &gt; n\)`.

The trace of a residual covariance matrix will be smaller if the model explains more variation.  Plotting it against the same parameter penalty used in AIC can be helpful for finding a .blue[parsimonious model].

### The common threads in statistical analysis of shape

There have been a few common threads that pervade the analysis of GM data
1. GM data are always multivariate and can be highly multivariate.  (An exception might be analysis of differences in centroid size among groups).
2. Shape analyses involve aligning data to some kind of matrix or vector, `\(\mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{Z}\)`.
  + That alignment can be decomposed with SVD: PCA, PLS, PACA
  + That alignment can be compared to alternative alignments: GLM
3. Statistical analysis means attaining a distribution of random alignments
  + The analysis might ascertain the location of the observed alignment in the distribution: PLS
  + The analysis might ascertain the location of an alignment comparison in the distribution: GLM (ANOVA, MANOVA)
  + The analysis might ascertain the location of a comparison of predictions made by the alignment (pairwise comparisons)

+ **In all cases, `\(\mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{Z}\)` is the starting point.  `\(\mathbf{Z}\)` is the matrix of shape data.  Understanding what `\(\mathbf{A}\)` is helps inform what the analysis intends to do.**
+ **In all cases that a `\(P\)`-value or `\(Z\)`-score is needed, RRPP is the workhorse for that.**

---

### Three parting comments

1. Many lecture topics in this workshop are sort of an applied view of this one.  Lecture 11 (RRPP Extensions) is especially a "cool stuff we can do with linear models and RRPP" topic.

2. It's okay if this is overwhelming.  *It gets easier by playing with real data, performing tests, interpreting results, and referring back to this lecture to "connect dots".*  This lecture is not intended as a pre-requisite of comprehension before entertaining any other topic.  It is intended as an oft-referenced source to help make other topics clear.

3. If you can appreciate that every statistical analysis is a permutation of `\(\mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{Z}\)` and every statistical test is an application of RRPP, using an appropriate null model, you are on your way to taking ownership of your data!
