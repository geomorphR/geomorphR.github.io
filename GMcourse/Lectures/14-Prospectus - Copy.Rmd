### Week in Review: Overarching Goal

+ Our goals for the week were:
  + 1: Learn how to quantify anatomical shapes using points, curves, and surfaces
  + 2: Generate a set of shape variables from these data 
  + 3: Statistically evaluate hypotheses of shape variation and covariation using robust statistical methods

.pull-left[    
+ Accomplishing these goals required use of the **Procrustes Paradigm** 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="90%"}
include_graphics("LectureData/01.Intro/GenGMProtocol.png")  
```
]

.pull-right[
+ This, then, **must** be coupled with **RRPP and effect size (Z-score) evaluation** for shape analysis: 

$$z =\frac{\log(F) - \mu_{\log(F)}}{\sigma_{\log(F)}}$$ 
]
---

### Recall the RRPP Procedure $^1$

+ For virtually all shape-based hypotheses, we used permutation procedures (RRPP). This is embodied as:

.pull-left[
1: Fit $\small\mathbf{X}_{R}$ for each $\small\mathbf{X}_{F}$; Estimate $\small\hat{\mathbf{Z}}_{R}$ and $\small\mathbf{E}_{R}$

2: Permute, $\small\mathbf{E}_{R}$: obtain pseudo-values as: $\small\mathbf{\mathcal{Z}} = \mathbf{\hat{Z}}_{R} + \mathbf{E}_{R}$

3: Fit $\small\mathbf{X}_{F}$ using $\small\mathbf{\mathcal{Z}}$: obtain coefficients and summary statistics

4: Calculate $\small{F}$-value (or other test statistic) in every random permutation (observed case counts as one permutation)

5: For $\small{n}$ permutations, $\small{P} = \frac{n(F_{random} \geq F_{obs})}{n}$
]
.pull-right[
6: Calculate *effect size* as a standard deviate of the observed value in a normalized distribution of random values (helps for comparing effects within and between models); i.e.:
$$\small{z} = \frac{
\log\left( F\right) - \mu_{\log\left(F\right)}
} {
 \sigma_{\log\left(F\right)}
}$$
where $\small\mu_{\log\left(F\right)}$ and $\sigma_{\log\left(F\right)}$ are the expected value and standard deviation from the sampling distribution, respectively.

### Procrustes Paradigm and RRPP: Present Applications

What we learned this week: Procrustes + RRPP with effect sizes ( $Z$-scores) provides the tools to evaluate an inordinately large breadth of biological hypotheses related to shape variation.  A partial list includes:

+ 1: General linear model (GLM) questions: 
  + Do groups differ in shape (manova)?
  + Is there covariation between shape and a continuous variable (regression)?
  + Is there variation in shape across multiple effects (factorial models)?
  + Is there an association between shape & $\small\mathbf{X}$ while accounting for phylogeny (PGLS models)? 
+ 2: 'Advanced' GLM questions: 
  + Which groups differ in shape; which slopes differ in terms of shape covariation (pairwise comparisons)?
  + Do pairs of groups differ in their magnitude or direction of shape change (trajectory analysis)?
  + Are there differences in the degree of shape disparity (dispersion) among groups?

---
    
### Procrustes Paradigm and RRPP: Present Applications (Cont.)

+ 3: Covariation questions:
  + Does shape covary with another set of variables (partial least squares - PLS)?
  + Is the degree of covariation greater in one dataset than another (z-score comparisons)?
+ 4: Phylogenetic questions: 
  + What is the degree of phylogenetic signal in shape?
  + Does shape covary with other variables while accounting for phylogenetic relatedness (PGLS and P-PLS)?
  + Do rates of phenotypic shape evolution differ?
+ 5: GM-specific questions: 
  + Is there shape asymmetry? Is it directional or fluctuating? 
  + For repeated shapes, is measurement error a concern?
  + Is there modular signal in my data?  Integrated signal? 
  + Is the degree of modularity (or integration) greater in one dataset relative to another?
  + Are there allometric patterns of shape variation? 

###### NOTE: A huge advantage of what we learned this week is the visualization of patterns of shape variation (i.e., statistical plots), combined with visualizations of shape deformations (predicted values, group means, etc.)

---

### What's Left to Do?

+ Given the breadth of topics we covered, one might reasonably ask "In terms of theory, is there anything left to do?"

+ Can empiricists expect additional novel approaches to be developed going forward, that help biologists address new and important questions?

--

+ We argue the answer to this question is **YES**!!

+ Here are some recent '*Up and Coming*' methods from Dean and Mike, as well as our musings on other possible areas of future work
---


### Current 1: Dimensions of Phylogenetic Signal 

+ The degree to which phenotypic similarity associates with phylogenetic relatedness

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", eval=TRUE,out.width="40%"}
include_graphics("lectureData/14.prospectus/PhySigConcept.png")
```

+ For multivariate data, we have $K_{mult}=\frac{\mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{Z},E(\mathbf{Z})}^{T}\mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{Z},E(\mathbf{Z})}}{\mathbf{PD}_{\tilde{\mathbf{Z}},0}^{T}\mathbf{PD}_{\tilde{\mathbf{Z}},0}}/\frac{tr(\mathbf\Omega)-N(\mathbf{1}^{T}\mathbf{\Omega1})^{-1}}{N-1}$

---

### Current 1: Dimensions of Phylogenetic Signal 

+ 100s of GMM (and other) studies have utilized $K_{mult}$: 

.pull-left[
```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", eval=TRUE,out.width="90%"}
include_graphics("lectureData/14.prospectus/PhySigWeakHist.png")
```

+ Such patterns often interpreted as "Significant, but weak phylogenetic signal"
]

--

.pull-right[

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", eval=TRUE,out.width="90%"}
include_graphics("lectureData/14.prospectus/PhySigSimul.png")
```

+ But phylogenetic signal could be "concentrated" in a few dimensions
]

+ How do we evaluate dimensions of phylogenetic signal in multivariate data? 

---

### Current 1: Dimensions of Phylogenetic Signal: Computations 

+ Re-examine $K$ and decompose it into component dimensions$^1$

+ Numerator of $K_{mult}$ is ratio of covariance matrices: 

$$\frac{tr\left((\mathbf{Z}-E(\mathbf{Z}))^T(\mathbf{Z}-E(\mathbf{Z})\right)}{tr\left((\mathbf{Z}-E(\mathbf{Z}))^T\mathbf\Omega^{-1}(\mathbf{Z}-E(\mathbf{Z}))\right)} = \frac{tr(SSCP_0)}{tr(SSCP_{\Omega})}$$ 
--

So rather than finding the trace of each component separately, summarize them as: 

$$K= \frac{SSCP_0}{SSCP_{\Omega}} = SSCP_{\Omega}^{-1}SSCP_0$$

This is a *relative eigenanalysis* of $SSCP_0$ relative to $SSCP_{\Omega}$


.footnote[1. Mitteroecker, Collyer, Adams. (2024: In Press). *Syst.Biol.*]
---

### Current 1: Dimensions of Phylogenetic Signal: Computations 

+ Perform *relative eigenanalysis* of $SSCP_0$ relative to $SSCP_{\Omega}$

$$K= \frac{SSCP_0}{SSCP_{\Omega}} = SSCP_{\Omega}^{-1}SSCP_0$$

+ Next, decompose as: $K=\mathbf{E}\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\mathbf{E}^T$

+ Diagonal elements of $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$ are eigenvalues

+ Summarize eigenvalues: $tr(K)=\sum\delta_i$ and $det(K)=\prod\delta_i$

+ Evaluate statistically via permutation
  + Note: $H_0$ is that $SSCP_0$ and $SSCP_{\Omega}$ are proportional, so:  $H_0 = \delta_1 = \delta_2 = \delta_3...$

.footnote[1. Mitteroecker, Collyer, Adams. (2024: In Press). *Syst.Biol.*]
---

### Current 1: Dimensions of Phylogenetic Signal: Example I

+ Papionins display strong and concentrated phylogenetic signal 

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", eval=TRUE,out.width="60%"}
include_graphics("lectureData/14.prospectus/PhySigHomin.png")
```

### Current 1: Dimensions of Phylogenetic Signal: Example II

+ Crocodylians display strong and concentrated phylogenetic signal 

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", eval=TRUE,out.width="60%"}

### Current 2: Phylogenetic Comparison of Microevolutionary Patterns

.pull-left[
Contemporary timescales: evaluate trends within species (microevolution)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="95%", fig.cap= ""}
include_graphics("lectureData/14.prospectus/Micro.png")
```

]

--

.pull-right[
Macroevolutionary timescales: evaluate trends across the phylogeny

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="95%", fig.cap= ""}
include_graphics("lectureData/14.prospectus/Macro.png")
```

Evaluated via phylogenetic comparative methods
]

--

+ When comparing intraspecific trends across species, we ***should*** account for phylogenetic nonindependence

+ How can we do that? 
---

### Current 2: PCMs and Multiple Individuals

PCMs use 1 individual per species (e.g., species means)

  - Assumes $\sigma^2_{within.spp} <<  \sigma^2_{among.spp}$

--

Using species means in presence of $\sigma^2_{within.spp}$ is problematic 

- Can $\uparrow$ bias in parameter estimates
- Can $\uparrow$ type I error, $\downarrow$ power, and $\uparrow$ model misspecification 

--

Some PCMs can include intraspecific variation (Ives et al. 2007; Felsenstein 2008), but

- $\sigma^2_{within.spp}$ is unstructured sampling error around the mean
- In other words, assume within-species variation is **random** (i.e., measurement error)

What about within-species variation that is not random? 

How can we account for it (or compare it across species)?
---

### Current 2: Extended Phylogenetic Least Squares (E-PGLS) $^1$

+ E-PGLS provide a bridge between micro- and macroevolutionary patterns
  + Can evaluate cross-species trends of trait covariation (univariate and multivariate) based on multiple individuals per species
  + Can compare within-species patterns across species while conditioning on the phylogeny

+ E-PGLS combines: 

  + Hierarchical linear model 
  + Expanded phylogenetic covariance matrix
  + Novel permutation procedure 

.footnote[1. Adams and Collyer (In Review)]
---

### Current 2: E-PGLS: Procedure

+ The E-PGLS model: $\mathbf{Z} = \mathbf{X}_S \hat{\mathbf{B}}_S + \mathbf{X}_X \hat{\mathbf{B}}_X + \mathbf{X}_{C_{X}}\hat{\mathbf{B}}_{C_{X}} + \mathbf{E}$

+ Phenotypic data, $\mathbf{Z}$, is described by a partitioned model, $\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{X}_S \vert \mathbf{X}_X \vert \mathbf{X}_{C_X}$, with residual error, $\mathbf{E}$, distributed as $\mathbf{E} \sim \mathcal{MN}(0,\boldsymbol{\Omega}_{n})$
    + $\boldsymbol{\Omega}_n$ is an expanded phylogenetic covariance matrix

$\boldsymbol{\Omega}_n = \mathbf{X}_S\boldsymbol{\Omega}\mathbf{X}_S^T$

### Future 1: An Improved Procrustes Algorithm

+ Recall the workhorse of geometric morphometrics: the Generalized Procrustes Analysis (superimposition)
  + Translate all specimens to a common location
  + Scale all specimens to unit centroid size
  + Optimally rotate all specimens to minimize LS deviations
    
```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align = "center", out.width="35%"}
source('LectureData/plot.specimens/plot.Specimens.r')
lizards <- readland.nts('LectureData/04.shape.vars/lizards_LAT.nts')

liz.lab <- read.csv('LectureData/04.shape.vars/liz_groups.csv',header=TRUE, sep="\t")

### Future 1: An Improved Procrustes Algorithm

.pull-left[
+ Mathematically, GPA assumes that all landmarks are 'iid' (independent, and identically distributed) in terms of their error distribution

+ This implies that the values for each landmark of each specimen are derived from a circular normal distribution, which is independent landmark by landmark

+ Such an assumption is unrealistic
]

--

.pull-right[
+ For example, recall the 'Pinocchio effect'

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
  include_graphics("LectureData/03.superimposition/GRF-Example.png")  
```

]

--

+ Here, some landmarks display greater variation than do others (and GRF was proposed to 'account' for this, via an ad-hoc procedure)

+ Also, consider the possibility that some landmarks are correlated with others (i.e., landmark changes are correlated)

+ Neither of these conditions is considered by GPA, as it is OLS (=unweighted)
---

### Future 1: Towards A Weighted Procrustes Algorithm

+ To this point (and for the past 25 years), we have conducted superimposition using GPA, which is an unweighted alignment

+ That is, one translates, rotates, and scales, using mean values

+ As implemented (and as described this week), these steps assume that all landmarks contribute equally during the alignment.

+ This is tantamount to including a $\mathbf{I}_{pk}$ identity matrix within the GPA algorithm

--

+ One could consider a 'weighted GPA' where the translation, rotation, and scale are performed relative to a landmark-coordinate covariance matrix (much like one performs OLS = unweighted regression versus PGLS =  phylogenetically-weighted regression)

+ The algebra for this is well-established statistically, but the 'weighting' covariance matrix in this case is highly singular, causing mathematical difficulties
---

### Future 1: Towards A Weighted Procrustes Algorithm

.pull-left[
+ Some approximations have been proposed (e.g., Theobald and Wuttke 2006)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="80%"}
include_graphics("LectureData/14.prospectus/WGPATheobald.png")  
```
]
.pull-right[
+ Here (with simplifying assumptions), one can align protein structures allowing for different variation among landmarks, but with equal variation within (i.e., using a partitioned $\hat{\mathbf\Sigma}=\mathbf\Sigma_p\otimes\Sigma_k$)

+ We are currently developing a general algorithm for weighted GPA that relaxes all of these assumptions, and where the 'standard' GPA approach would be a special case algorithm
]
---

### Future 2: Integration and Modularity: A Spatial Perspective

+ The past decade has seen a wonderful resurgence of interest in modularity and integration

+ This has lead to the development of numerous approaches for *quantifying* such patterns

--

+ Recent work (Bookstein 2016) highlighted the need to explore integration across spatial scales 

+ This begs the question: should other (all?) patterns of integration and modularity among sub-units be evaluated relative to some 'null' expectation beyond that of the empirical sampling distribution derived from permuting landmarks into modules?

--

+ We contend that this is an important issue for future investigation

+ Our perspective is to consider the **spatial** proximity of landmarks in developing a null model for integration and modularity tests
---

### Future 2: Spatial Integration and Modularity

.pull-left[
+ In ecology, data obtained from different geographic localities is expected to covary due to their *spatial proximity*

+ In other words, geographically proximate locations are expected to be more similar, and covary more highly, than are geographically less proximate locations

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%"}
include_graphics("LectureData/14.prospectus/SpatialCov.png")  
```
]

--

.pull-right[
+ For morphometrics, **anatomical proximity** is akin to geographic proximity in spatial statistics

+ We contend that null models of integration and modularity should be **conditioned** on anatomical proximity; analogously to spatial proximity issues

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="65%"}
include_graphics("LectureData/14.prospectus/Mouse.png")  
```

+ We are presently developing integration and modularity methods that evaluate patterns relative to this anatomical proximity

### Future 3: Multivariate Model Comparison

+ The goal is to evaluate two or more models with different sets of parameters to determine if one is 'better' based on criteria quantifying the *fit* of the data to those models.

+ Procedurally, model fit is often obtained using likelihood:

$$\mathcal{L}(\hat{\beta}|\textbf{y}) = \frac{e^{-\frac{1}{2}( \textbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\hat\beta)^T\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}^{-1} ( \textbf{y} - \mathbf{X}\hat\beta)}}{\sqrt{2\pi^{np}|\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}|}}$$
+ Likelihood ratio tests are then performed to compare models

$$-2\lambda_{LR}= -2*\frac{\mathcal{L}(\hat{\beta}_0|\textbf{y})}{\mathcal{L}(\hat{\beta}_1|\textbf{y})} \sim\chi^2$$

--

+ LRT-based hypothesis testing is what we've used throughout this workshop to evaluate linear models 

+ Possible shortcomings include: 
  + Model overfitting (improper application can lead one to infer that an overly complicated model is best)
  + LRT is commonly not used for non-nested models (though it can be: Vuong 1989; Lewis et al. 2011)


---

### Future 3: Multivariate Model Comparison

+ Models are also compared using indexing measures of penalized likelihood (e.g., AIC).

$$AIC = -2\mathcal{L}(\hat{\beta}|\textbf{y}) + 2[pk+0.5p(p+1)]$$

+ Lower AIC values represent preferred models, with a cut-off typically stated as $\small\Delta_{AIC} > 4$ (for *univariate* data)

--

+ AIC (and similar) measures represent a 'balance' between model fit and the number of parameters used

+ They are related to Kullback–Leibler information theory, and are a sort of 'distance'

+ Note that for multivariate data, the parameter penalty can become quite 'heavy')


---

### Model Comparison via RRPP-Based Effect Sizes

+ One can combine the strengths of LRT and AIC via RRPP-based effect sizes

  + For each candidate model, $\mathcal{L}(\hat{\beta}|\textbf{y})$ can be obtained
  + RRPP may be used to generate an empirical sampling distribution of $\mathcal{L}(\hat{\beta}|\textbf{y})$
  + An effect size, $Z$-score, may be calculated for each model

--

+ Larger $Z$-scores imply a stronger strength of signal for that model

+ This is akin to a 'distance' of the candidate model relative to an intercept model: $Z \sim 1$
+ The model with the largest $Z$-score is the best model
+ NOTE: one can also perform two-sample comparisons of effect sizes (sensu Adams and Collyer 2016; 2019) to compare models

---

### Future 3: Multivariate Model Comparison: Example

+ Here is a simple (univariate) example using AIC: 

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%"}
data(Pupfish)
Pupfish$logSize <- log(Pupfish$CS)
pupfish.pc<-prcomp(Pupfish$coords)$x
gps<-factor(paste(Pupfish$Sex,Pupfish$Pop))
```

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%"}
fit.0<-lm(Pupfish$logSize~1)
fit.S<-lm(Pupfish$logSize~Pupfish$Sex)
fit.P<-lm(Pupfish$logSize~Pupfish$Pop)
fit.SP<-lm(Pupfish$logSize~Pupfish$Sex+Pupfish$Pop)
fit.Full<-lm(Pupfish$logSize~Pupfish$Sex*Pupfish$Pop)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%"}
AIC(fit.0,fit.S,fit.P,fit.SP,fit.Full)
```
]

+ Based on AIC, the best model is $\small{Size}={Sex}+{Pop}$ 

---

### Future 3: Multivariate Model Comparison: Example

+ Using likelihood ratio tests (anova), this model is also preferred

.scrollable[
```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%"}
anova(fit.Full)
```
]

---

### Future 3: Multivariate Model Comparison: Example

+ And now let's look at the effect sizes of the models:

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%"}
fit.0<-lm.rrpp(Pupfish$logSize~1)
fit.S<-lm.rrpp(Pupfish$logSize~Pupfish$Sex)
fit.P<-lm.rrpp(Pupfish$logSize~Pupfish$Pop)
fit.SP<-lm.rrpp(Pupfish$logSize~Pupfish$Sex+Pupfish$Pop)
fit.Full<-lm.rrpp(Pupfish$logSize~Pupfish$Sex*Pupfish$Pop)
```


comp.Z <- model.comparison(fit.0, fit.S, fit.P, fit.SP, fit.Full, type = "Z")
summary(comp.Z)

+ Again in this case, the model with the strongest signal is $\small{Size}={Sex}+{Pop}$ 

+ **Clearly, there is considerable work left to do to verify this new theoretical procedure, but the initial concept of using $Z$-scores from RRPP for model comparison is promising!** *Stay tuned...*
