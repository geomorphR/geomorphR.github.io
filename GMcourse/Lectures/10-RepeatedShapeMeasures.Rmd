### Symmetry and Asymmetry

+ Many objects are built symmetrically

+ Paired structures and serially homologous body parts are organized in a symmetric way

--

+ Bilateral symmetry: structures arranged in either side of the body mid-line (axis of symmetry)

+ Symmetry poses some challenges for morphometric data analysis

---

### Types of Bilateral Symmetry

- Two main types of bilateral symmetry:
- **Matching symmetry**: pairs of structures are found across the mid-line of the object (e.g. insect wings, tetrapod limbs etc)
- **Object symmetry**: single structure with internal structural symmetry (e.g. structures in vertebrate skull)

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="100%"}
include_graphics("LectureData/10.asymmetry/SymmTypes.png")  
```

---

### The Problem with Symmetrical Objects

+ Landmark positions are not independent in symmetric objects
+ Lack of statistical independence for paired landmarks
+ Some dimensions of shape space have little variance
+ SSCP matrices become singular (or nearly so)
  + This causes issues with parametric statistical hypothesis-testing methods ('divide' by zero or nearly so)
    
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="40%"}
include_graphics("LectureData/10.asymmetry/SymmLizard.png")  
```  

--

+ The problem becomes more acute as objects become more symmetrical!

---

### The Problem with Symmetrical Objects (Cont.)

+ The data in reality have fewer dimensions, so use less data. How?
  + Digitize only half structure
  + Reflect structure and take the average: make a symmetrical structure
+ Using only $\frac{1}{2}$ structure has challenges:
  + Does not represent entire shape
  + Can introduce assymetries because the midline is not 'anchored' during the analysis 

+ Solution: use **entire structure** and **RRPP** for statistical evaluation!

###### As we've seen this week, RRPP, combined with robust summary test statistics, does not require inverting (nearly) singular covariance matrices, so model evaluation is not compromised by this issue.
---

### Symmetric Objects: Example

+ Note the large number of shape dimensions with no variation. Much of this is due to bilateral symmetry!

.scrollable[
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", eval=TRUE, out.width="40%"}
lizards <- readland.tps('LectureData/07.allometry/symm.shape2.tps', warnmsg = FALSE)
liz.lab <- read.csv('LectureData/07.allometry/ind.info.txt',header=TRUE, sep=",")
Y.gpa <- gpagen(lizards, print.progress = FALSE)
CS <- liz.lab$cs
type <- liz.lab$type
gdf <- geomorph.data.frame(Y.gpa, CS = CS, type = type)
plotAllSpecimens(Y.gpa$coords)

res <- prcomp(two.d.array(Y.gpa$coords))
summary(res)
```
]

---

### The Biology of Asymmetry

+ Different types of asymmetry are thought to have a biological meaning

+ **Directional asymmetry**: consistent difference skewed towards one of the sides (at the population level); thought to reflect difference in use, e.g. fiddler crabs feeding vs. fighting displays

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="40%"}
include_graphics("LectureData/10.asymmetry/FiddlerCrab.png")  
``` 

--

+ **Fluctuating asymmetry**: thought to reflect instability during development (genetic, environmental etc)

+ Long debate about the meaning of FA
---

### Types of Symmetry

+ Perfect symmetry is rare in biology; objects nearly always have some degree of asymmetry

+ Three main types of asymmetry have been described, based on the statistical distribution of asymmetry in the population

--

+ **1: Directional**: consistent $\small{(R-L)}$ differences with one side always larger than the other: $\small{\overline{(R-L)}\neq0}$

+ **2: Fluctuating**: small random $\small{(R-L)}$ deviations with $\small{\overline{(R-L)}=0}$

+ **3: Antisymmetry**: consistent $\small{(R-L)}$ differences, but larger side random

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
include_graphics("LectureData/10.asymmetry/SymmTypesHist.png")  
``` 
---

### Analysis of Symmetry: General Procedure

+ The presence of various types of asymmetry may be evaluated using one of several  factorial ANOVA designs

+ Traits need to be quantified multiple  times, so that measurement error may be quantified

+ This allows one to evaluate if the (normally small) differences between sides are actually “real” or due to measurement error (ME)

--

+ ANOVA then often set up as:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
include_graphics("LectureData/10.asymmetry/AnovaDesign.png")  
``` 
---

### Extensions to GM Shape Data 

```{r, echo = FALSE,fig.align = "center",  out.width="70%"}
include_graphics("LectureData/10.asymmetry/ReflectObjects.png")  
```

+ **Procedure**
  + 1: Digitize right and left structures (or R and L sides), possibly multiple times for ME
  + 2: Reflect one side to match the other (and relabel landmarks for object symmetry)
  + 3: GPA + projection to tangent space
  + 4: Factorial ANOVA – SS for Individual, SS Side (DA), SS Side x Individual (FA) 
  + 5: Assess model factors via permutation approaches

### Decomposition of Asymmetry Component

+ One can approach the problem more theoretically (rather than 'procedurally')
  + ANOVA effects represent Sums of Squares, which correspond to various asymmetry components
  + Therefore, decomposing SST (total shape variation) obtained via $\small{D}_{Proc}$ provides variance components for both DA and FA

$$\small{SST}=\sum^n_1{D}^2_{(X_i,Y_i)}=nD^2_{(\overline{X},\overline{Y})}+\sum^n_1{D}^2_{(X_i-\overline{X},Y_i-\overline{Y})}$$

--

+ where: $\small{nD}^2_{(\overline{X},\overline{Y})}$ represents the **Directional Asymmetry** component

+ and: $\small\sum^n_1{D}^2_{(X_i-\overline{X},Y_i-\overline{Y})}$ represents the **Fluctuating Asymmetry** component

### Other Types of Asymmetry

+ Many other types of (a)symmetry are present in biological data
+ How can we quantify asymmetry for these structures?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="70%"}
include_graphics("LectureData/10.asymmetry/HigherSymm.png")  
``` 
---

### Symmetry Groups

+ One can approach the problem by defining **Symmetry Groups**
+ Symmetry groups: transformations that leave the data invariant
+ e.g.: bilateral symmetry = reflection across the midline

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="40%"}
include_graphics("LectureData/10.asymmetry/SymmGroups.png")  
``` 

+ Symmetry groups define transformations such that there are invariances in those symmetric 'dimensions'
+ These groups describe the ways in which symmetry can be defined, and thus quantified for more complex structures (e.g., radial symmetry)

### Symmetry: Extended Protocol

.pull-left[
+ For bilateral asymmetry: transformation = reflection
+ For other types, decompose asymmetry to the components defining the symmetry type based on the appropriate symmetry groups

+ Example: Rotational Symmetry
  + Digitize all p components 
  + GPA + projection
  + Decompose shape variation into symmetry components, quantify and evaluate

### Symmetry: Summary

+ Symmetry causes redundancy in shape data 
+ Can account for symmetry effects analytically 
+ Asymmetry: biological significance
+ FA: developmental instability
+ DA: adaptation?
+ Use ANOVA procedures to separate variation within (asymmetry) and among individuals
+ Extensions to different types of symmetry
