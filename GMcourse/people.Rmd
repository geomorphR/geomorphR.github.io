For over 20 years, Dean and Mike have collaborated on developing quantitative approaches for the analysis of biological data, with an emphasize on multivariate phenotypes (*geometric morphometrics*). They regularly teach courses in biostatistics at their home institutions, and are co-instructors of international workshops in quantitative biological methods (Geometric Morphometics and Multivariate Statistics). They are the primary authors and maintainers of two popular R-packages: `RRPP` and `geomorph`. Mike and Dean are both elected Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and Dean is a recipient of the Rohlf Medal for Excellence in Morphometric Methods.
